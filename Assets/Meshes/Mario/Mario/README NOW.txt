What's new?

V2 of this model includes the following

- New higher poly head made to be more accurate to the cutscenes.
- Fixed the arms to allow for better bends
- New textures
- UV animated eyes and eyelids
- Overhauled the IK constraints so that Mario's hands and feet aren't detached
- Improved Mario's mustashe to be more accurate
- Added 3D buttons to Mario's overalls

This model was orignally created in December 2021.
This updated model was rejected due to the eye textures not beining big enough. Luckly I fixed it.
Also I had trouble getting the shapekeys into the fbx so I was just like "fuck it" and went with no shapekeys just to save myself from spending more time on this problem.

Why was this not done sooner? 
At the time I lost all passion in the things I did such as art, 3d modeling, or watching YouTube content I liked. I still feel this way to some extent but now I'm trying to make more content in an effort to establish more of an online preasence and hopefull make friends.
Anyways I hope you find some good use out of the model.


Have a good day ;)
